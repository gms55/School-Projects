Executing Test 1.
Inserting nodes with the following keys: 3, 201, 60, 30, 45 (in this order).
Running the tree walk and printing the nodes in increasing order: 3 30 45 60 201 
Retrieving the node with key 201.
The node was found: true.
Deleting nodes with keys 3 and 60.
Running the tree walk and printing the nodes in increasing order: 30 45 201 
This verifies that the nodes with keys 3 and 60 were deleted.


Executing Test 2.
Insert nodes with the following keys: -10, -150, 4, 300, 45, -50, 200 (in this order).
Running the tree walk and printing the nodes in increasing order: -150 -50 -10 4 45 200 300 
Retrieving the node with key -150.
The node was found: true.
Deleting nodes with keys -10 and 45.
Running the tree walk and printing the nodes in increasing order: -150 -50 4 200 300 
This verifies that the nodes with keys -10 and 45 were deleted.


This concludes the testing.
